# Station Red

This project, named Station Red, was started in Spring 2020 and is in development. The goal of this project is to expand my knowledge of Unity. There are many objects and classes that I was not initially aware of but now decently know how to use. This includes Canvases for implementing buttons and other UI elements, Player Preferences for saving data, Events for minimizing dependencies. Design patterns such as singleton managers have also been useful for creating clean code.
